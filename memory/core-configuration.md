# Core Clawdbot Configuration: Memory Embeds (QMD)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-07 14:18 CST
**Configuration Details:** Laxy has manually configured the built-in memory embeds feature.

## Key Memory Embed Settings:
- **Embedding Model:** `embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0` (local embedding model)
- **Automatic Memory Indexing:** Enabled
- **Session Transcript Archiving:** Enabled
- **Memory Search System:** Configured to use the built-in QMD system.

This configuration was updated in `openclaw.json` and a restart was performed to activate persistent semantic memory. This ensures improved long-term context retention and search capabilities.
